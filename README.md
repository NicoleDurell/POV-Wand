# POV-Wand
This project is for my computer science 207 (Building Interactive Gadgets) course for university.

The persistence of vision (POV) wand is a device that allows you to display messages via LEDs by waving a wand back and forth, and your eyes will hold the image of the light which will allow you to see a message despite the stimulant no longer being there. When the wand is held still, the LEDs appear to just be flickering, and waving the wand is the only way to portray the message.
This is an arduino based project (althoug I accidentally bought a Chinese knock off because it looked the same and was cheaper, but still work with the arduino software), and is a simple beginner project for people new to coding and engineering of gadgets, such as myself.
