# POV-Wand
This project is for my computer science 207 (Building Interactive Gadgets) course for university.

The persistence of vision (POV) wand is a device that allows you to display messages via LEDs by waving a wand back and forth, and your eyes will hold the image of the light which will allow you to see a message despite the stimulant no longer being there. When the wand is held still, the LEDs appear to just be flickering, and waving the wand is the only way to portray the message.
This is an arduino based project (althoug I accidentally bought a Chinese knock off because it looked the same and was cheaper, but still work with the arduino software), and is a simple beginner project for people new to coding and engineering of gadgets, such as myself.

**Requirements and Materials**
* Arduino Software https://www.arduino.cc/en/main/software

* Elegoo (or Arduino) circuit board (1)
* Screw shield (1)
* 9 Volt Battery (1)
* LEDs (19)
* Push Button (1)
* 660 Ohm resistors (19)
* 1 Megaohm resistor (1)
* Wires of varying lengths (22)
* Zip ties (2)
* Screws and nuts (3 of each)

**Build**
(**I don't know what's up, but images aren't uploading, and I have another big assignment due the same day as this. You can find "POV Wand Schem" in the file POV Images, as well as "Wand", which can help you build it.**)

**Usage**
What messages do you want to portray? You can program several messages to rotate through by editing the code and changing the messages. Want to write band names or member's names for a concert and show them you are a dedicated fan? Did your car break down on the side of the highway and nobody is pulling over to help, or you find yourself waiting for assistance? Maybe you went camping or wandered off the beaten path and got lost. "SOS" is a handy message to be able to display, and having this gadget can possibly assist in your rescue. Be corny and propose by coding "Will You Marry Me" in a few different messages. Really, this tool is versatile enough that it is all up to the desires and imagination of the builder and wielder of the POV Wand.

Thank you to my dad, George, this project would have been a nightmare without your help, as would the semester.
